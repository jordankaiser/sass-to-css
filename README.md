# Tools to help migrate SCSS to CSS.

This programs functionality is broken out into specific tools that are helpful when transitioning a project from SCSS to CSS. Those tools are:

- Create a custom variables file based off of a SCSS variable file.
- Find and replace SCSS variables with CSS variables.

This tool includes a CLI which can be started by running `npm run start`.

# Instructions

1. Configure the variables in `scss-to-css.config.js`.
2. Run `npm run start`.

# Notes

See `.nvmrc` for required node version.
